 of particle physics experiments.&nbsp; As the journey of construction, 
experimentation and interpretation of the results has meant learning a 
little bit more about the fascinating world of particles and forces that
 make up the universe.&nbsp;</p><p>If you would like to discuss ideas

 are energetic particles originating from deep space that hit our 
atmosphere 30km above the Earth’s surface. They come from a variety of 
sources including our own Sun, other stars and distant interstellar 
objects such as black wholes, but most are the accelerated remnants of 
supernova explosions.</p><p>Although commonly called cosmic rays the term <strong>"ray"</strong>
 is a misnomer, as cosmic particles arrive individually as a primary 
particle, not as a ray or beams of particles. 90% are Protons, 9% helium
 nuclei, and the remainder electrons or other particels.</p><p><strong>Matter smashing energy</strong><br>When
 these primary particles hit, they do so with such tremendous energy 
they rip their way into our atmosphere with atom smashing power. Cosmic 
rays are commonly known to have energies well over 10<sup>20</sup> eV (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_volts" target="_blank">electron volts</a>), far more than any particle accelerator built here on earth, like the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider" target="_blank"> Large Hadron Collider</a> (LHC).</p><p>These
 interactions produce an exotic zoo of high energy particles and 
anti-particles high in the earth's atmosphere such as positive and 
negative <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pions" target="_blank">pions</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaons" target="_blank">kaons</a> that subsequently decay into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muons" target="_blank">muons</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon_neutrino" target="_blank">muon neutrinos</a> (including cascades of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protons">protons</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrons" target="_blank">neutrons</a> as a result of nucleonic decay). Where uncharged pions decay into pairs of high energy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photons" target="_blank">photons</a> they become the starting points of large cascades of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrons" target="_blank">electrons</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positrons" target="_blank">positrons</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_rays" target="_blank">gamma rays</a>.
 The resulting flux of particles at ground level consists mainly of 
muons and electrons/positrons in the ratio of roughly 75% : 25% still 
with energies greater than 4GeV travelling at near the speed of light 
~0.998c.</p><p><strong>Common interstellar events on earth of which most people are unaware</strong><br>Muons
 created by the interaction of cosmic rays and our atmosphere lose their
 energy gradually. Muons start with high energies and therefore have the
 capacity to ionise many atoms before their energy is exhausted. 
Further, as muons have little mass and travel at nearly the speed of 
light, they do not interact efficiently with other matter. This means 
they can travel through substantial lengths of matter before being 
stopped. Consequently, muons are all around us, passing through just 
about everything. They can penetrate mountains, buildings, our bodies, 
and deep into the Earth’s surface, without anyone really being aware of 
their existence other than scientists and obsessive geeks</p><p></p><p><strong>Time Travellers</strong><br>Muons
 created by the interaction of cosmic rays are an everyday demonstration
 of Einstein's theory of relativity. A muon has a measured mean lifetime
 of 2.2 microseconds. Consequently, they should only be able to travel a
 distance of 660 metres even at near the speed of light and should not 
be capable of reaching the ground.&nbsp;However Einstein's theory showed
 that time ticks slowly for particles moving at speeds close to that of 
light. Whilst the mean lifetime of the muon at rest is only a few 
microseconds, when it moves at near the speed of light its lifetime is 
increased by a factor of ten or more giving these muons plenty of time 
to reach the ground.</p><div align="center"><iframe allowfullscreen="" src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/C3ue7cEocvI.html" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe></div></div><div id="node-4" class="section-3"><h1 class="book-heading">Theory of Detecting Cosmic Rays</h1><p>Unfortunately a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon" target="_blank">muon</a> created as a result of <a href="http://hardhack.org.au/cosmic_rays_are">Cosmic Rays</a>
 is not easily seen, but their after-effects when passing through is a 
little more easier, typically most forms of radiation detectors will do 
the job. The oldest and most famous example of this is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_chamber" target="blank">Cloud chamber</a>. There is an operational cloud chamber installed and running at the <a href="http://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au/" target="blank">South Australian Museum </a>and is well worth a look (I think its fascinating).</p><p class="rtecenter"><iframe src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/1vSTsADQXG8.html" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe></p><p>Other radiation detectors can be used like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger_counter" target="blank">Geiger Counters</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spark_chamber" target="blank">Spark Chambers</a>, Resistive Plate Chambers and materials called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintillator" target="blank">Scintillators </a>which give off light when an ionizing particle passes through them.</p><p>The
 problem using a radiation detector for a cosmic ray observation is that
 there is larger amounts of terrestrial radiation as much 73% of 
background radiation is due to the natural decay of matter. Although in 
small quantities it is sufficient to make it difficult to discriminate 
between a terrestrial or cosmic source.</p><p>Consequently at least two detectors are needed placed one above the other, feed into electronics that can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence_circuit" target="_blank">monitor coincidence</a> between the two detectors quickly thus potentially filtering out most terrestrial radiation.</p><p class="rtecenter"><img alt="directional coincidence" src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/coincidance.png" style="border-style:solid; border-width:0px; height:353px; width:796px"></p><p>Cosmic
 particles travel at nearly the speed of light and so do not ionise very
 efficiently and hence can travel through matter very easily passing 
through both detectors without effort, whereas the terrestrial radiation
 may not. Consequently anything detected in both detectors 
simultaneously is more likely to be a cosmic event than terrestrial.</p><p>Well
 almost simultaneously, if a muon is travelling at 0.998c and the 
detectors where spaced 5cm apart the actual flight time of a muon would 
be just 0.16ns. However as the detector and electronics response and 
delay times would be much slower than this, we can say in "real-life" 
terms it is simultaneous.</p><p>The main idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence_circuit" target="_blank">coincidence detection</a>
 in signal processing is that if a detector detects a signal pulse in 
the midst of random noise pulses inherent in the detector, there is a 
certain probability, <em>p</em>, that the detected pulse is actually a 
noise pulse. But if two detectors detect the signal pulse 
simultaneously, the probability that it is a noise pulse in the 
detectors is <em>p</em><sup>2</sup>. Suppose <em>p</em> = 0.1. Then <em>p</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.01. Thus the chance of a false detection is reduced by the use of coincidence detection.</p></div><div id="node-93" class="section-3"><h1 class="book-heading">Issues to consider in the design of Muon (cosmic ray) Detectors</h1><p><strong>Muon Energy</strong><br>Muons
 created by the interaction of cosmic rays and our atmosphere lose their
 energy gradually by ionisation of the material through which they pass.
 As they start with high energies they have the capacity to ionise many 
atoms before their energy is exhausted. Also, as they travel at nearly 
the speed of light, they tend not to ionise very efficiently and hence 
can travel through substantial lengths of matter, some metres of lead, 
before being stopped. Consequently, coincidence detection methods are 
the only real reliable way to discriminate between terrestrial radiation
 and cosmic sources.</p><p><strong>Penetrative Terrestrial Radiation</strong><br>I've
 been very surprised how penetrative local terrestrial radioactive 
sources can be. For example natural Cobalt-60 gammas can have energies 
up to 1.3 MeV and so could penetrate upto 10mm of lead. In all detector 
array designs either Geiger–Müller or Scintillator-Photomultiplier 
configurations, this can cause a substantial number of false detections.
 This particularly becomes a problem of detectors with small surface 
areas (aperture). Consequently, it is recommended that radiation 
shielding be included in your design to reduce the problem and increase 
reliability.</p><p><strong>Compton Scattering</strong><br>Compton 
Scattering is an effect where an interaction between charged electrons 
within the detector and high energy photons result in the electron being
 given part of the energy, causing a recoil effect of another high 
energy photon, which may enter into the adjacent detector causing a 
false coincidence detection.</p><p>In other words placing detectors too 
close to each other may cause cross-talk interference in coincidence 
mode, and so radiation shielding should be added or the detectors spaced
 further apart. However increased spacing also has the negative effect 
of decreasing the aperture of the detector and so the expected count.</p><p><strong>Geiger–Müller Tube Detector Pulse Width</strong><br>The
 Geiger–Müller tube is a very good detector of Muons however it would 
seem that filtering out background radiation using a simple coincidence 
detector systems alone is problematic due to the Geiger–Müller tube 
response and decay time (Pulse Width) when a muon has passed through and
 is detected.</p><p>Consequently, the wider the Pulse Width the greater 
the number of false positives. The means a pulse shorting or quenching 
circuit is also needed to shorten the Pulse Width to a period closer to 
the expected flight time of the Muon between tubes, but not too narrow 
that the electronics cannot measure relative coincidence. Some 
improvement might also be achieved by spacing the tubes further apart, 
but this also has the negative effect of decreasing the aperture of the 
detector.</p><p><strong>Detector using Scintillators</strong><br>As 
muons travel at nearly the speed of light, they tend not to ionise very 
efficiently and hence can travel through substantial lengths of matter, 
some metres of lead, before being stopped. This means that although a 
Scintillator-Photomultiplier detector has the potential to measure the 
energy of an ionising particle they can not discern between a muon and 
any other radiation caused by terrestrial sources and so must be used in
 a coincidence detection mode.</p><p>The major advantage of 
Scintillator-Photomultiplier detectors over a Geiger–Müller Detector is 
that a photomultiplier has a very fast response time and so more 
accurate than Geiger–Müller Detector in coincidence mode. Also as 
Scintillator panels can be made to have a much larger surface areas 
means a greater number of muons can be detected compared to other 
radiation caused by terrestrial sources, further increasing accuracy.</p><p>The major disadvantage of Scintillator-Photomultiplier detectors is cost and complexity.</p><p><strong>Lead Shielding</strong><br>Lead
 plays an important role as a material to shield against environmental 
radioactivity due to its high density and atomic number together with 
reasonable mechanical properties and acceptable cost. This role is 
however hindered by the unavoidable natural presence of Pb-210, which 
undergoes beta decay, with the consequent emission of gamma radiation.</p><p>Again
 why coincidence detection methods are the only real reliable way to 
discriminate between terrestrial radiation and cosmic sources.</p></div><div id="node-96" class="section-3"><h1 class="book-heading">Cosmic Ray (Muon) 18 Tube Drift Hodoscope</h1><p>This project was an experiment to see if a multilayered array of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger%E2%80%93M%C3%BCller_tube" target="_blank">Geiger–Müller Tubes (GMT)</a> could track ionizing particles as they pass through.&nbsp; The result is an interesting display demonstrating how <a href="http://www.hardhack.org.au/cosmic_rays_are">cosmic rays </a>travel down through the atmosphere at different angles.</p><div><a href="http://www.hardhack.org.au/cosmic_ray_telescope"><img alt="Cosmic Ray Drift Hodoscope" src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/cosmic_ray_hodoscope.jpg" style="height:551px; width:800px"></a></div><div>Called a&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodoscope" target="_blank">Hodoscope&nbsp;</a>(from the Greek "hodos" for way or path, and "skopos:" an observer) it is a type of detector commonly unsed in&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics" target="_blank" title="Particle physics">particle physics</a>&nbsp;that make use of an array of detectors to determine the trajectory of an energetic particle.</div><p class="rtecenter"><iframe src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/mS0uctt3K6c.xhtml" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe></p><p>In

 is one of the first visual test of the circuit, which has been updated a
 number of times since this video. Although the new circuit produces 
less false positives and hence less flashes, the video here offers a 
good demonstration of what the output data looks like. The LED flash 
times are slowed by a one-shot timer, as the pulses are so short they 
would not be visible if the LEDs where driven directly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div align="center"><img src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/muon_detector_v8.gif"><br><small>Version 7. 1st August 2009</small></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After
 a number of different configurations and tests, I have distilled the 
design down to a simple circuit seen here. The outputs 4,5,6 give a 
positive 5V logic pulse when a coincidence is detected in two or more of
 the tubes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div align="center"><img src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/detector_pcb.jpg"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Although
 Geiger–Müller tubes are sensitive to Muons, the response time to decay 
(Pulse Width) when a muon is detected is relatively long for measuring 
the probability of coincidence in two or more the tubes. This means the 
wider the Pulse Width the greater the number of false positives. 
Consequently some means of pulse shortening is required to shorten the 
Pulse Width to a shorter period to decrease the probability that it is 
terrestrial radiation hitting the tubes in close succession.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div align="center"><img src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/pulse_trace.jpg"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The
 CRO trace above demonstrates what happens in this circuit when a wider 
pulse in feed in. The bottom trace is the output and only responds to a 
negative travelling pulse regardless of pulse shape. This is also 
important as the Geiger–Müller tube is positively biased and when a 
particle is detected the output swings negative, so the circuit ensures 
that only the first micro second of the detector pulse is processed in 
the coincidence circuit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div align="center"><img src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/3T_cosmic_ray.jpg"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why
 3 tubes? I hear you say, well it is all about increasing the detectors 
aperture size to muons as most Geiger–Müller tubes available are longer 
than they are wide. So as an attempt to achieve a larger aperture as 
well as coincidence detection without using rows of tubes in each layer I
 am combining the coincidence outputs from top-middle and middle-bottom 
detectors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div align="center"><img src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/aperture.png"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The
 prototype provides six positive 5V logic outputs to a din socket. 1) 
Top tube - all detections 2) Middle tube - all detections 3) Bottom tube
 - all detections (all detections) meaning both cosmic and background 
radiation 4) Top and Middle - coincidence detection 5) Bottom and Middle
 - coincidence detection 6) "Top &amp; Middle" or "Middle &amp; Bottom" -
 coincidence detection (coincidence detection) meaning a stronger 
likelihood of a cosmic source than terrestrial source being detected. 
Outputs 4 and 5 are the main outputs, but to give some visual 
information that the detector is working I've added some LEDs driven by 
one-shot timers to give a 1/8 second flash, as the output pulses are 
only a micro second and wouldn't be seen if used to drive the LEDs 
directly. Output 6 drives the blue LED indicating a confirmed 
coincidence in two or more tubes and where outputs 1,2 &amp; 3 drive the
 red LEDs indicating any detection in the adjacent tube.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div align="center"><img src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/one_shot_timer.gif"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Coincidence Detection</strong>
 The main idea of 'coincidence detection' in signal processing is that 
if a detector detects a signal pulse in the midst of random noise pulses
 inherent in the detector, there is a certain probability, p, that the 
detected pulse is actually a noise pulse. But if two detectors detect 
the signal pulse simultaneously, the probability that it is a noise 
pulse in the detectors is <span class="texhtml"><i>p</i><sup>2</sup></span>. Suppose <span class="texhtml"><i>p</i> = 0.1</span>. Then <span class="texhtml"><i>p</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.01</span>. Thus the chance of a false detection is reduced by the use of coincidence detection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div id="node-55" class="section-4"><h1 class="book-heading">Detector Using 2 Pancake Geiger–Müller Tubes</h1><p>I'm also making a two tube variation of the 3 tube design using Pancake Geiger–Müller tubes as they have a larger surface area.</p><p></p><center><p><img src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/2E_cosmic_telescope.jpg"></p><p></p></center><p></p></div><div id="node-56" class="section-4"><h1 class="book-heading">Issues with detectors using Geiger–Müller Tubes</h1><p><strong>What should the count rate be?</strong><br>The theoretical rate of cosmic rays is of the order of 1 count per minute per cm<sup>2</sup>
 of active area, but it does depend on solid angle, so this number is 
only approximate. Assuming each GM tube has a broadside active area 
about 10 cm<sup>2</sup>, the number of counts maybe 10 per minute.</p><p>If the rate of each tube; S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>, and S<sub>3</sub> counts per second and the coincidence gate width is τ seconds, then if counter #1 is ON S<sub>1</sub>τ , and the random coincidences in tube #2 at a rate R<sub>12</sub> = S<sub>1</sub>S<sub>2</sub>τ
 random coincidences per second. So the random coincidence rate should 
be less than 1% of what is expected for the real coincidence rate, or 
about 0.1 counts per minute for a 10 cm<sup>2</sup> Detector.<small> (Many thanks to Bob S for this information)</small></p><p><strong>Compton Scattering</strong><br>One of the reasons for false counts in a Geiger–Müller array detector maybe due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton_scattering" target="_blank">Compton Scattering, </a>where
 an interaction between charged electrons within the detector and high 
energy photons result in the electron being given part of the energy, 
causing a recoil effect of a high energy photon into the adjacent 
detector causing a false coincidence detection. In other words this 
causes cross-talk interference between GM Tubes</p><p>Consequently 
radiation shielding is required between each GM Tube of either 6mm of 
lead, 12mm of copper or 25mm of aluminium (note Iron is unsuitable). <small>(Many thanks to Bob S for this information)</small></p><p>August
 13th 2009 - To date tests carried out using radiation shielding between
 the GM tubes don't indicate that this is a real problem, however any 
cross-talk between each the tubes or the electronic is a real concern 
and should be design into any detector array.</p><p><strong>Detector pulse width</strong><br>In
 theory the Geiger–Müller tube is a very good detector of Muons (Cosmic 
Rays) however it would seem that filtering out background radiation 
using a simple coincidence detector is problematic due to the 
Geiger–Müller tube response and decay time (Pulse Width) when an 
ionising particle has been detected.</p><p>Consequently, the wider the 
Pulse Width the greater the number of false positives. The means a pulse
 shorting or quenching circuit is also needed to shorten the Pulse Width
 to a period closer to the expected flight time of the Muon between 
tubes, but not too narrow that the electronics cannot measure relative 
coincidence. Some improvement might also be achieved by spacing the 
tubes further apart, but this also has the negative effect of decreasing
 the aperture of the detector.</p><p><strong>Coincidence</strong><br>Although
 coincidence implies simultaneously, in reality we are talking about 
almost simultaneous, this is because a muon created by a cosmic event is
 travelling at near the speed of light 0.998c, so if the detectors are 
only spaced 2.5cm apart the actual flight time of a muon would only be 
0.08ns. However as the detector and electronics response and delay times
 are slower than this, we can say in "real-life terms" it is 
simultaneous.</p></div><div id="node-66" class="section-4"><h1 class="book-heading">Sonification of Muons via Arduino and Max/MSP</h1><p>I loaned my <a href="http://hardhack.org.au/geiger_muller_detector" title="Muon Detector using Geiger–Müller Tubes">3 Tube Muon Detector</a> to <a href="http://little-scale.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Sebastian Tomczak </a>who has rigged it up for some experimental sonification.</p><p>More information available on his website <a href="http://little-scale.blogspot.com/2009/10/cosmic-radiation-detection-sample.html" target="_blank">Little-scale</a></p><p><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/fNovzSwrUVE&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/fNovzSwrUVEhlenfs1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="344" width="425"></object></p></div></div><div id="node-94" class="section-3"><h1 class="book-heading">Cosmic Ray (Muon) Detector using Geiger–Müller tubes within lead shielding</h1><p>This Geiger–Müller Array (or Geiger tube telescope) exploits an effect called <a href="http://hardhack.org.au/electromagnetic_cascades">Electromagnetic Cascade</a> as a means of significantly increasing the effective aperture of the detector while reducing <a href="http://www.hardhack.org.au/detector_issues" target="_blank">other issues</a> I've identified in experiments with <a href="http://www.hardhack.org.au/cosmic_rays">cosmic ray detection.</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><div align="center"><img alt="Muon Detector using Geiger–Müller Array and Lead Sheilding" src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/prototype_building.jpg" border="0"><br><small>Prototype v1.

 of&nbsp;UHMWPE (Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene) &nbsp;or 
280mm of Paraffin Wax. &nbsp;Low energy neutrons cannot penetrate this 
material, but are not absorbed by it. consequently, non-cosmic ray 
induced neutrons are kept out of the monitor and low energy neutrons 
generated in the lead are kept in which is&nbsp;largely transparent to 
the cosmic ray induced cascade of neutrons.</li> <li><strong>Producer</strong>
 -&nbsp;40mm of&nbsp;Lead . Fast neutrons that get through the reflector
 interact with the lead to produce, on average about 10 much lower 
energy neutrons. This both amplifies the cosmic signal and produces 
neutrons that cannot easily escape the reflector.</li> <li><strong>Moderator</strong> -&nbsp;<b><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 20px; ">20mm&nbsp;</span></b><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><span style="line-height: 19px;">of&nbsp;</span></font>UHMWPE

 After very slow neutrons are generated by the reflector, producer,

 project was deliberately aimed at developing a very low cost cosmic ray
 detector using common Fluorescent Tubes. It was based on variation of 
an experiment performed in 2000 by the CERN (European Organization for 
Nuclear Research) laboratories by Dr. Schmeling which found a simple 
method for detecting and visualizing cosmic rays using everyday 
fluorescent tubes inside a wire mesh of feed with a high voltage.</p><p>There is a link here at the <a href="http://teachers.web.cern.ch/teachers/archiv/hst2000/teaching/expt/sascha/sascha.htm" target="_blank">Teachers CERN Website </a>at the bottom of their page, unfortunately there is little/no information about how this actually works.</p><p>However one of the very best websites I have found on working Fluorescent Tube cosmic ray detectors is <a href="http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dastroparticelle.it%26hl%3Den%26biw%3D1280%26bih%3D855%26prmd%3Dimvns&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=it&amp;twu=1&amp;u=http://www.astroparticelle.it/muon-detector2_eng.asp&amp;usg=ALkJrhh0Vo7IBnSLXpu7u71koFSYC_JVVA">www.astroparticelle.it</a> if you are interested in this type of design you could do no better.</p><p>I have now begun building a number of other types of detectors due to a number of <a href="http://hardhack.org.au/fluroesent_tube_issues">issues I identified in my design using Fluorescent Tubes</a> below is what I had done so far.</p><div id="node-6" class="section-4"><h1 class="book-heading">Prototype 1 - Detector using fluorescent tubes (Very Unstable)</h1><p><strong>Note:</strong> This prototype is too unstable and not recommended.</p><p></p><center><img src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/Detector.jpg" alt="Cosmic Rays with fluorescent tubes" border="0"><br><small>First Prototype demonstrated at Dorkbot Meeting</small></center><p></p><p>My
 first detector prototype was not that dissimilar to the CERN example, 
except the fluorescent tubes are placed between three metal plates. The 
outer plates are connected together by bolts and connected to the 
Negative rail of the supply and the centre plate is insulated by the 
fluorescent tubes and connected to the Positive rail of the supply. So 
far I have found the best result with small 6W fluorescent tubes is 
around 650V DC</p><p></p><center><img src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/detector_flro_1.gif" alt="Cosmic Rays with fluorescent tubes 0" border="0"><br><small>First Prototype Built</small></center><p></p><p>Like
 the CERN example, when a muon flys through the fluorescent tube, the 
gas inside ionizes due to the high voltage field across the plates. As a
 result of the ionization the resistance across the plates will fall 
slightly and so it should be possible to measure this as a change in 
current flow in the high voltage source.</p><p></p><center><img src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/muon_0.gif" alt="Cosmic Rays with fluorescent tubes 1" border="0"><br><small>Schematic of first tests.</small></center><p></p><p>The reason for two rows of fluorescent tubes is to sense the crude presents of <strong>coincidence</strong>
 occurring in the top and bottom rows of fluorescent tubes due to a muon
 flying through both. I'm speculating that the resistance in the 
detector should be half compared with only one row detecting something, 
due to terrestrial noise. If the output is feed into a data logger and 
also speculate that over time the difference between cosmic and 
terrestrial detections could be filtered.</p><h3><strong>Off on a tangent again.</strong></h3><p>I
 couldn't help noticing the similarity with flash tubes and other types 
of gas filled trigger electronics like a Thyratron thermionic valve. 
Basically these tubes are biased at a voltage below ionization and when a
 high voltage trigger is applied briefly in the gas path between the 
Cathode and Anode, the gas to within the tube ionizes, the resistance to
 falls rapidly between the Cathode and Anode and like SCR current flows 
until power is removed.</p><p>Consequently I tried biasing the 
individual fluorescent tubes using their standard electrodes with a DC 
voltage somewhere below their point of ionization ~70V through a high 
impedance RC network. The RC network preventing sustained ionization, so
 producing just a pulse.</p><p></p><center><img src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/muon_5.gif" alt="Cosmic Ray Detector 1" border="0"><br><small>Schematic of trigger experiments various component values where tried</small></center><p></p><p>However,
 to my surprise I got quite the opposite, as I measured a voltage spike 
across the electrodes rather than a dip and so it would seem biasing may
 not be required as a strong positive spike can be clearly observed on a
 CRO without any biasing.</p><p></p><center><img src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/muon_4.gif" alt="Cosmic Ray Detector 1" border="0"></center><p></p><p></p><center><img src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/CRD_prototype_1.jpg" alt="Cosmic Ray Detector 1" border="0"><br><small>Schematic of experiment first tried and demonstrated at a Dorkbot meeting.</small></center><p></p><h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3><p>Nevertheless,
 even though "something" is causing clear observable pulses on a CRO in 
all variations tested above, it is difficult to confirm they are 
actually due to Cosmic Rays or Terrestrial Radiation over something like
 coronal discharges within the tube itself.</p><p>All attempts to find 
RFI sources have drawn a blank as pulses disappeared when the high 
voltage supply was switched off, other Electrical Interference has also 
been ruled out shielding inside a metal box. I also ruled out the supply
 itself without the detector and could not find any other interference 
sources.</p><p></p><center><embed id="VideoPlayback" src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/googleplayer.swf" style="width:400px;height:326px" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"> </center><p></p><p>I
 should also note that early in my building and testing of these ideas, I
 found that most HV supplies I built had quite allot of noise or ripple 
present, specially the type often recommended for Geiger Counters, so I 
spent quite a bit of time trying to eliminate this, with improved 
voltage regulation and a good bank of capacitors.</p><h3><strong>Results</strong></h3><p>Tests
 with an xray source have confirmed the system dose detect radiation, 
however once the gas inside the tube ionizes, spurious pulses re-occur 
randomly after, which I suspect is caused by photons being emitted 
inside the tube causing new avalanches occur. Increasing the impedance 
of the high voltage supply and placing a discharge resistor in circuit 
does reduce some of the problem, but this also decreases the output 
signal. Also I have moved away from using the filament electrodes of the
 lamp, although this also detects radiation successfully with a high 
output voltage it also significantly increases the problem of 
oscillation and other spurious pulses.</p><p>So I have moved to a new improvement prototype with better coupling and RFI controls see: <a href="http://hardhack.org.au/cosmic_ray_detector_2">Prototype 2 for details.</a></p><div id="node-30" class="section-5"><h1 class="book-heading">Radioactive Source for testing a detector</h1><p></p><center><img src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/radioactive-atom.gif" alt="Radioactivity for testing" border="0"><br></center><p></p><p>In
 the process of developing my low-cost Cosmic Ray Detector (Muon 
Detector) it has become increasingly clear that I first should confirm 
that a common fluorescent lamp can be used to detect radioactive 
particles when placed between a high voltage electric field.</p><p>Although the idea has been demonstrated in a simple experiment describe at the <a href="http://teachers.web.cern.ch/teachers/archiv/hst2000/teaching/expt/sascha/sascha.htm" target="_blank">High School Teachers CERN lab</a> and the <a href="http://www.cosmicrays.org/muon-spark-chamber.php" target="_blank">CosmicRays.org website</a>, the detector described relies solely on visual confirmation of faint flashes over multiple tubes.</p><p></p><center><img src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/flurotube.gif" alt="Cosmic Rays with fluorescent tubes" border="0"></center><p></p><p>Where
 my muon detector relies on the assumption that a current draw can be 
measured in the high voltage supply, when the gas inside the fluorescent
 tube ionises. Consequently, it will be very important to see if under 
controlled conditions a radioactive particle will trigger such an 
effect.</p><p></p><center><img src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/muon_0.gif" alt="Cosmic Rays with fluorescent tubes 1" border="0"><br><small>Basic Test Schematic.</small></center><p></p><p>Unfortunately,
 I haven’t yet been able to source a radioactive sample to use in a 
test, as there seems legal restrictions in Australia that prevent 
amateur experimenter owning such samples, nor putting them through the 
post even with a weak level of radiation.</p><p>I have even visited 
numerous antique stores with my Geiger Counter looking for uranium based
 ceramics or glass without success, well nothing that is good enough for
 testing. But I have had many strange looks and questions when I pull 
out my pocket Geiger Counter.</p><p>So I build a low-level x-ray source 
using a Vacuum Tube and high voltage ~50KV. Although slightly more 
dangerous an xray source can be switched on and off at the flick of a 
switch which has een bvery useful for testing the detector.</p></div></div><div id="node-35" class="section-4"><h1 class="book-heading">Prototype 2 - Detector using fluorescent tubes (improved still unstable)</h1><p><strong>Note: </strong>This

 and fine tune the design...</p></div><div id="node-43" class="section-4"><h1 class="book-heading">Electrical characteristics of the fluorescent tube detector.</h1><p>The
 resistance of the gas within a fluorescent lamp is virtually an open 
circuit at room temperature until a sufficient electric field is applied
 where the gas atoms absorb enough energy to emit a free electrons 
resulting in ionization. Once the gas is ionised the electrical 
characteristics of the fluorescent lamp changes and begins to conduct 
electricity with a negative differential resistance and so more current 
flows. Consequently, the electrical resistance of the fluorescent lamp 
drops dramatically from many mega ohms to hundreds of ohms.</p><div align="center"><img alt="ionization" src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/ionization.gif" border="0"></div><p>Ionisation
 of the gas within fluorescent lamp occurs at around 300 to 600V 
depending on the size of tube, environmental factors and the type of gas
 mixture used by the manufacturer this is usually a low pressure mercury
 vapour and a mixture of either argon, xenon, neon, or krypton. In the 
cosmic ray (muon) detector the electrodes are not in direct contact with
 the gas inside the tube but capacitive coupled through the glass wall 
as identified in <strong>Diagram 1</strong>. Where <strong>C1 </strong>represents the capacitive effect of these electrodes and <strong>R1</strong> in series with <strong>VD </strong>represent the gas inside the tube. <strong>CP</strong> represents the parallel capacitance of the overall coupling effect from the two electrodes across the entire tube.</p><div align="center"><img alt="Basic Circuit" src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/Basic_Circuit.gif" border="0"></div><p>When a high voltage is applied <strong>E </strong>(~750
 to 1800V) across the circuit it creates an electrostatic field within 
the gas and when this charge reaches sufficient energy the gas ionises 
(emitting a flash of light) causing the field to collapses and 
discharging <strong>C1 </strong>until the charge can build once again. If not quenched rapidly or the voltage applied is too high the circuit forms a basic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_oscillator" target="_blank">relaxation oscillator</a> and the process repeats itself rapidly proportional to the time constant of <strong>C1 </strong>and <strong>R1</strong>. In the detector configuration in below the voltage <strong>E </strong>is set at a point just below ionisation. The <strong>1M Resistor&nbsp;</strong> (<strong>Note</strong> experiment with R values) forms a series RC network with the tube capacitance <strong>C1 </strong>ensuring that only a small amount of energy is stored which can be easily quenched shortly after being triggered. The 4 <strong>10Meg Resistors</strong> (<strong>Note</strong> experiment with values) also play an important role by reducing parallel capacitance, preventing the voltage across the tube <strong>C1 </strong>to
 run away due to the high impedance of the supply causing oscillation 
and also ensures a zero bias to the filaments of the fluorescent tube 
reducing the production of spurious pulses and discharges within the 
tube.</p><div align="center"><img alt="Basic detector circuit" src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/muon_fluorescent_0.gif" border="0"><br><strong>Diagram 2</strong></div><p>Consequently,
 when a Muon passes through the tube, some of the gas molecules are 
ionised, creating positively charged ions, and electrons. The strong 
electric field created by the electrodes accelerate the ions towards the
 negative side of the tube wall and the electrons towards the positive 
side of the tube walls. The ion pairs should gain sufficient energy to 
ionise the gas further through collisions along the way, creating an 
avalanche of charged particles and discharging the energy in <strong>C1 </strong>resulting in a short pulse of current which can be measured across the <strong>1 Meg resistor </strong>as a negative travelling pulse of voltage, not dissimilar to a Geiger-Müller tube.</p><div align="center"><img alt="Inside the tube" src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/tube_ions.gif" border="0"></div></div><div id="node-50" class="section-4"><h1 class="book-heading">Issues using Fluorescent Tubes</h1><p>I have been testing a number of different design variations and have identified the following issues.</p><p>1) Power supply requires good filtering and regulation - Completed <a href="http://hardhack.org.au/hv_reg_power">High Voltage Regulated Power Supply</a><br>2) Tubes vary in voltage requirements from one tube to another even between the same make, model and age<br>3) Oscillation is a problem as the supply voltage and/or coupling plate surface area increase<br>4) Internal filament electrodes must be insulated, even loose coupling increases oscillation and spurious pulses<br>5) Coupling plates should be positioned back 1cm from the tip of the internal filament electrodes<br>6) Oscillation occurs as the circuit forms a basic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_oscillator" target="_blank">relaxation oscillator</a></p><p>Although
 oscillation is an unwanted artifact, it would also seem there is a 
point before oscillation begins where the tube increases sensitivity to 
radiation as the voltage increase and approaches a point where 
oscillation begins. However, radiation (cosmic or terrestrial) is also 
what first triggers the tube to jump into an unstable state before free 
oscillation begins.</p><p>Nevertheless, I will investigate this further 
to see how oscillation could be regulated through some form of negative 
feedback or quenching circuit as this may yield useful results.</p><p><strong>Compton Scattering</strong><br>Tests using a Geiger–Müller array detector have revealed a problem which will equally effect fluorescent tubes detector called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton_scattering" target="_blank">Compton Scattering, </a>this
 is where an interaction between charged electrons within the detector 
and high energy photons result in the electron being given part of the 
energy, causing a recoil effect of a high energy photon into the 
adjacent detector causing a false coincidence detection. In other words 
this causes cross-talk interference between Detector Tubes</p></div><div id="node-46" class="section-4"><h1 class="book-heading">Fluorescent Tube Detector Electronics</h1><p>The electronics component of the detector is an important part of a Cosmic Ray Telescope and comes in two main parts.</p><strong>Detection Circuit</strong><br><p>One
 of the problems with building a detector using fluorescent tube is that
 although it functions very much like a Geiger-Müller tube the voltage 
is higher; the signal has a very high output impedance and is capacitive
 coupled. So the following considerations needed to be included in the 
circuit design:</p><ol><li>The amplifier section must tolerate high voltages and have a high input impedance.</li> <li>Capacitive
 coupling introduces an AC signal characteristics and amplitude 
variations, so the output needs shaping through a Schmitt trigger for 
better stability and noise immunity.</li> <li>The high voltage power 
supply must have good filtering and be regulated to decrease amplitude 
variations and introduction of noise.</li></ol><strong>Coincidence Circuit</strong><br><p>The
 main problem with the physical muon detector is that in essence it is a
 radiation detector and along with muons showering down from the skies 
there also equal amounts of terrestrial radiation present in the 
environment including the detector itself. Although this is in very 
small quantities it is sufficient to make it difficult to discriminate 
between a terrestrial or cosmic events.</p><img src="Cosmic%20Ray%20Detectors_files/coincidence_detector.gif" alt="directional coincidence" border="0"><p>However,
 a muon does have sufficient energy to pass through the physical 
detector easily, whereas terrestrial radiation will not. Therefore 
anything detected in two or more detectors placed one above the other, 
simultaneously (coincidence) is almost certainly a cosmic event. 
Consequently, having electronics that can measure coincidence across two
 or more detectors is essential.</p><p>To do this task the output of the Schmitt Trigger is feed into a logic gate eg: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AND_gate" target="_blank">AND Gate</a> where the output could be captured by a data logger recording counts over time or other devices.</p><p><strong>Pulse Shortening</strong><br>Tests using other more reliable detector systems such as <a href="http://hardhack.org.au/geiger_muller_detector">Geiger–Müller Tubes </a>have
 shown that a simple coincidence detector using a AND Gate by itself is 
problematic due to the response and decay time (Pulse Width) of the 
detector when an ionising particle has been detected.</p><p>Consequently,
 the wider the Pulse Width the greater the number of false positives. 
The means a pulse shorting or quenching circuit is also needed to 
shorten the Pulse Width to a period closer to the expected flight time 
of the Muon between tubes, but not too narrow that the electronics 
cannot measure relative coincidence. Some improvement might also be 
achieved by spacing the tubes further apart, but this also has the 
negative effect of decreasing the aperture of the detector.</p></div></div><div id="node-95" class="section-3"><h1 class="book-heading">Cosmic Ray induced radio emissions</h1><p>The
 first experiment in which radio emission was detected from high energy 
particles was an array of dipoles was operated by a team of British and 
Irish physicists in 1964-5 at the Jodrell Bank Radio Observatory in 
conjunction with a simple air shower trigger. The array operated at 44 
MHz with 2.75 MHz bandwidth. Out of 4,500 triggers a clear 
bandwidth-limited radio pulse was seen in 11 events. This corresponded 
to a cosmic ray trigger threshold of 5x10^16 eV and was of intensity 
close to that predicted. This has been further confirmed by many 
otherexperiments over the years and is now currently used in many well 
known projects such as <a href="http://www.lofar.org/">LOFAR</a> and at the <a href="http://www.auger.org/">Pierre Auger Observatory</a>.</p><p>Cosmic
 rays are known to initiate a cascade of particle collisions in which 
large multiplicities of secondary particles of all kinds are produced. 
In the creation and annihilation of these secondary particles 
air-showers of charged particle are produced and travel down through the
 atmosphere near the speed of light to the ground. A large part of these
 charged particles consist of electron-positron pairs which emit a radio
 signal as they are deflected by the Earth's magnetic field. This 
process is known as a geo-synchrotron emission.</p><p>Radio signals 
produced are in the region of 10-100 MHz where most power received is at
 the lower frequencies due to coherence effects and so the spectrum 
begins to fall off at around 50 MHz. However due to short duration of 
the radio pulse typically less than 10nS it becomes increasingly 
difficult to measure at low frequencies and so most observations of 
cosmic ray induced radio emissions are made between 40 and 60Mhz.</p><div>Further
 due to the relativistic motion of these radio emissions they are 
concentrated into a beam in a forward direction so the footprint of the 
radio signal is concentrated around the particle shower by only several 
hundred meters. This makes the method of particle showers detection an 
ideal companion for other traditional particle shower observations by 
providing reinforcing information about the trajectory and energy of the
 incoming shower.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>As the number of 
particles in the air shower and peak radio signal correlate with the 
energy of the original primary particle and so the radio emission 
increases with the angle between the particle showers trajectory and the
 Earth’s magnetic field.</div></div><div id="node-74" class="section-3"><h1 class="book-heading">Cosmic Ray effects on Earths' climate</h1><p>From
 the available research their is no convincing evidence that confirm 
cosmic rays are a “major factor” in determining cloud cover. The 
ionising of air by cosmic rays will impart an electric charge to 
aerosols, which in theory could encourage them to clump together to form
 particles large enough to form cloud droplets, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_condensation_nuclei" target="_blank">"cloud condensation nuclei".</a></p><p>However,
 the majority of physicist who research this area say such clumping has 
yet shown to occur. Even if it does, it seems far-fetched to expect any 
great effect on the amount of clouds in the atmosphere. Most of the 
atmosphere, even relatively clean marine air, has plenty of cloud 
condensation nuclei already.</p><p>It is also not even clear whether the
 satellite measurements of changes in cloudiness are correct or how 
these changes have affected temperature, as it is unknown if clouds 
cover may mitigate global warming or amplify it.</p><p>----</p><p><small>For the record, the <a href="http://hardhack.org.au/Administrator">Administrator</a> of this website agrees with the findings of the <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/" target="_blank">IPCC assessment </a>of
