        <p>Connectors are used to join subsections of circuits together.
 Usually, a connector is used where it may be desirable to disconnect 
the subsections at some future time: power inputs, peripheral 
connections, or boards which may need to be replaced.</p>

        <h2 id="connector-terminology-">Connector Terminology </h2>
        <p>Before we get started discussing some commonly used connectors, let’s explore the terminology used to describe connectors.</p>

<p><strong>Gender</strong> - The gender of a connector refers to whether
 it plugs in or is plugged into and is typically male or female, 
respectively (kids, ask your parents for a more thorough explanation). 
Unfortunately, there are cases where a connector may be referred to as 
“male” when it would appear to be female; in the examples section, we’ll
 point a few of those out as we discuss individual component types and 
explain why that’s the case.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/2/6/0/7/f/51141810ce395f4d7e000007.jpg"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/51141810ce395f4d7e000007.jpg" alt="Male and female 2.0mm PH series JST connectors"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em>Male (left) and female 2.0mm PH series JST connectors. In this case, gender is determined by the individual conductor.</em></p>

<p><strong>Polarity</strong> - Most connectors can only be connected in 
one orientation. This trait is called polarity, and connectors which 
have some means to prevent them being connected wrong are said to be <strong>polarized</strong>, or sometimes <strong>keyed</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/5/1/0/d/c/51154c1cce395f903d000001.jpg"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/51154c1cce395f903d000001.jpg" alt="North America wall plug"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em>A polarized North American wall plug.
 By having two different widths for the plug blades, the plug will only 
go into the outlet one way.</em></p>

<p><strong>Contact</strong> - Contacts are the business portion of the 
connector. They are the metal parts which touch each other, forming an 
electrical connection. This is also where problems occur: the contacts 
can become soiled or oxidized, or the springiness required to hold the 
contacts together may fade with time.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/7/4/d/c/6/511414a4ce395f337e000007.jpg"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/511414a4ce395f337e000007.jpg" alt="ADH8066 mating connector"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em>The contacts on this connector are clearly visible.</em></p>

<p><strong>Pitch</strong> - Many connectors consist of an array of 
contacts in a repeated pattern. The pitch of the connector is the 
distance from the center of one contact to the center of the next. This 
is important, because there are many families of contacts which look 
very similar but may differ in pitch, making it difficult to know that 
you are purchasing the right mating connector.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/b/c/9/7/1/5148c334ce395f8e55000000.jpg"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/5148c334ce395f8e55000000.jpg" alt=".1&quot; pin header connector examples"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em>The pitch of the pins on the headers on a standard Arduino is .1".</em></p>

<p><strong>Mating cycles</strong> - Connectors have a finite life, and 
connecting and disconnecting them is what wears them out. Datasheets 
usually present that information in terms of <strong>mating cycles</strong>,
 and it varies widely from one technology to another. A USB connector 
may have a lifetime in the thousands or tens of thousands of cycles, 
while a board-to-board connector designed for use inside of consumer 
electronics may be limited to tens of cycles. It’s important that you 
select a connector with a suitable life for the application.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/9/1/d/b/b/51141922ce395fd17d00000a.jpg"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/51141922ce395fd17d00000a.jpg" alt="Connector for GS406 GPS module"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9079">Mating connector</a> for the GS406 GPS module. The <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/GPS/Modules/SPK-GPS-GS406-1R.pdf">connector’s datasheet</a> indicates a maximum of 50 insertion cycles for this part.</em></p>

<p><strong>Mount</strong> - This one has the potential for being 
confusing. The term “mount” can refer to several things: how the 
connector is mounted in use (panel mount, free-hanging, board mount), 
what the angle of the connector is relative to its attachment (straight 
or right-angle), or how it is mechanically attached (solder tab, surface
 mount, through hole). We’ll discuss this more in the examples section 
for each individual connector.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/b/5/4/1/6/51140d09ce395f697e000003.jpg"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/51140d09ce395f697e000003.jpg" alt="Comparison of different mounting methods for barrel-type connectors"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em>A comparison of three different 
methods of mounting the same barrel connector: (left to right) board 
mount, inline cable mount, and panel mount.</em></p>

<p><strong>Strain relief</strong> - When a connector mounts to a board 
or cable, the electrical connections tend to be somewhat fragile. It is 
typical to provide some kind of strain relief to transfer any forces 
acting on that connector to a more mechanically sound object than the 
fragile electrical connections. Again, there will be some good examples 
of this later on.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/c/a/3/6/6/5113dc95ce395fe501000000.png"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/5113dc95ce395fe501000000.png" alt="1/8&quot; Headphone jack showing strain relief"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em>This 1/8" headphone jack comes with a

 from being transmitted directly to the electrical joints.</em></p>      </div>
          <div class="section tutorial-page">
        <h2 id="usb-connectors">USB Connectors</h2>
        <p><strong>USB connectors</strong> come in two flavors: host and
 peripheral. In the USB standard, there is a difference between the two,
 and the connectors on cables and devices reflect this. However, all USB
 connectors will have some things in common:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Polarization</strong> - A USB connector can only nominally be inserted one way. It may be possible to force a connector in wrong, but that <em>will</em> result in damage to the device.</li>
<li><strong>Four contacts</strong> - All USB connectors have at least four contacts (although some may have five, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_3.0">USB 3.0</a>
 connectors have even more). These are for power, ground, and two data 
lines (D+ and D-). USB connectors are designed to transmit 5V, up to 
500mA.</li>
<li><strong>Shielding</strong> - USB connectors are shielded, such that a
 metal shell which is not part of the electrical circuit is provided. 
This is important to keep the signal intact in environments with a lot 
of electrical “noise”.</li>
<li><strong>Robust power connection</strong> - It’s important for the 
power pins to make connection before the data lines, to avoid trying to 
power the device over the data lines. All USB connectors are designed 
with this in mind.</li>
<li><strong>Molded strain relief</strong> - All USB cables have plastic 
overmolding at the connector to prevent strain on the cable that could 
potentially damage the electrical connections.</li>
</ul>


<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/e/4/c/4/b/5112e967ce395fc826000002.png"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/5112e967ce395fc826000002.png" alt="Labeled image of USB extension cable"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em>A <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/518">USB extension cable</a>, with some of the common features of USB connectors labeled.</em></p>

<h3>USB-A Connectors</h3>

<p><strong>USB-A female</strong> is the standard “host” connector type. 
This is found on computers, hubs, or any device intended to have 
peripherals plugged into it. It is also possible to find extension 
cables with a female A connector and a male A connector on the other 
end.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/6/2/0/e/3/5113cf7fce395fb17e000000.JPG"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/5113cf7fce395fb17e000000.JPG" alt="USB-A ports on a laptop computer."></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em><strong>Female USB-A</strong> ports on the side of a laptop. The blue connector is USB 3.0 compliant.</em></p>

<p><strong>USB-A male</strong> is the standard “peripheral” connector 
type. Most USB cables will have one end terminating in a USB-A male 
connector, and many devices (such as keyboards and mice) will have a 
built-in cable terminated with a USB-A male connector. It’s also 
possible to find USB-A male connectors that are board mountable, for 
devices like USB memory sticks.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/2/a/f/d/4/51154e04ce395f6140000005.jpg"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/51154e04ce395f6140000005.jpg" alt="USB-A male connector examples"></a></p>

<h3>USB-B Connectors</h3>

<p><strong>USB-B female</strong> is a standard for peripheral devices. 
It’s bulky, but robust, so in applications where size is not an issue, 
it’s the preferred means for providing a removable connector for USB 
connectivity. It is usually a through-hole board mount connector, for 
maximum reliability, but there are panel-mount options for it as well.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/5/3/d/3/b/5113e953ce395fbf7d000007.JPG"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/5113e953ce395fbf7d000007.JPG" alt="USB-B connector on an Arduino Uno"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em>Arduino boards, including this <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11224">Uno</a>, have long used the female <strong>USB-B</strong> connector, due to its low cost and durability.</em></p>

<p><strong>USB-B male</strong> is almost exclusively found at the end of
 a cable. USB-B cables are ubiquitous and inexpensive, which also 
contributes to the popularity of the USB-B connection.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/f/7/4/a/7/51154e0ece395fee3f000002.jpg"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/51154e0ece395fee3f000002.jpg" alt="Male USB-B connector"></a></p>

<h3>USB-Mini Connectors</h3>

<p>The <strong>USB-Mini</strong> connection was the first standard 
attempt to reduce the size of the USB connector for smaller devices. 
USB-Mini female is typically found on smaller peripherals (MP3 players, 
older cellphones, small external hard drives), and is usually a surface 
mount connector, trading robustness for size. USB-Mini is slowly being 
phased out in favor of the USB-Micro connector.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/8/e/e/9/0/51154e0ece395f0440000004.jpg"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/51154e0ece395f0440000004.jpg" alt="USB-Mini female connector"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em><strong>USB-Mini female</strong> connector on a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10889">Protosnap Pro Mini</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>USB-Mini male</strong> is another cable-only connector. As with USB-B, it’s extremely common, and cables can be found cheaply almost anywhere.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/e/a/2/5/3/5113e5f8ce395faa7d000004.JPG"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/5113e5f8ce395faa7d000004.JPG" alt="USB-Mini male connector"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em><strong>USB-Mini male</strong> connector on the end of a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11515">SparkFun Cerberus cable</a>.</em></p>

<h3>USB-Micro Connectors</h3>

<p><strong>USB-Micro</strong> is a fairly recent addition to the USB 
connector family. As with USB-Mini, the primary concern is size 
reduction, but USB-Micro adds a fifth pin for low-speed signalling, 
allowing it to be used in USB-OTG (On-the-go) applications where a 
device may want to operate as either a host or a peripheral depending on
 circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>USB-Micro female</strong> is found on many newer peripherals,
 such as digital cameras and MP3 players. The adoption of USB-micro as a
 standard charge port for all new cellular phones and tablet computers 
means that chargers and data cables are becoming increasingly common, 
and USB-Micro is likely to supplant USB-Mini in the coming years as the 
small-factor USB connector of choice.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/0/d/8/8/5/5113e6a5ce395f1c7e000000.JPG"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/5113e6a5ce395f1c7e000000.JPG" alt="USB-Micro female connector"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em><strong>USB-Micro female</strong> connector on a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11190">LilyPad Arduino USB</a> board.</em></p>

<p><strong>USB-Micro male</strong> is also a cable-only connector. There
 are generally two types of cables with USB-Micro male ends: one for 
connecting a device with a USB-Micro port as a peripheral to a USB host 
device and one for adapting the USB-Micro female port to a USB-A female 
port, to be used in USB-OTG capable devices.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/b/5/c/0/c/5113e63fce395ffe7d000000.JPG"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/5113e63fce395ffe7d000000.JPG" alt="USB-Micro male connector"></a></p>

        <h2 id="audio-connectors">Audio Connectors</h2>
        <p>Another familiar connector group are those used for 
audio-visual applications–RCA and phono. While these can’t truly be 
considered to be of the same family, as the various USB connectors are, 
we’ll consider both of them to be in the same vein.</p>

<h3>“Phone” Type Connectors</h3>

<p>You’ll probably immediately recognize the 1/8" version of this 
connector as a the plug on the end of a pair of headphones. These 
connectors actually come in three common sizes: ¼" (6.35mm), 1/8" 
(3.5mm), and 2.5mm. ¼" size connectors find a lot of use in the 
professional audio and music community- most electric guitars and 
amplifiers have ¼" tip-sleeve (TS) jacks on them. 1/8" tip-ring-sleeve 
(TRS) is very common as the connector for headphones or audio output 
signals on MP3 players or computers. Some cell phones will provide a 
2.5mm tip-ring-ring-sleeve (TRRS) jack for connecting to headphones that
 also include a microphone for hands-free communications.</p>

<p>The common availability of these connectors and cables makes them a 
good candidate for general purpose connectivity applications–for 
instance, long before USB, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-85">Texas Instruments graphing calculators</a>
 used a 2.5mm TRS connector for a serial programming connector. It 
should be remembered that tip-sleeve connector types are not designed 
for carrying power; during insertion, the tip and the sleeve can be 
momentarily shorted together, which may damage the power supply. The 
lack of shielding makes them poor candidates for high-speed data, but 
low speed serial data can be passed through these connectors.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/c/a/3/6/6/5113dc95ce395fe501000000.png"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/5113dc95ce395fe501000000.png" alt="1/8&quot; TRS phone plug"></a></p>

inserted, an internal switch connects the tip and ring pins to the 
adjacent unmarked pins, allowing insertion detection.</em></p>

<h3>RCA Connectors</h3>

<p>Familiar as the home-stereo connector of choice for many decades, the
 RCA connector was introduced in the 1940s by RCA for home phonographs. 
It is slowly being supplanted by connections like HDMI in the 
audio-visual realm, but the ubiquity of the connectors and cables makes 
it a good candidate for home-built systems. It will be a long time 
before it is obsolete.</p>

<p>Female RCA connectors are usually found on devices, although it is 
possible to find extension or conversion cables with female jacks on 
them. Most RCA connectors are connected to one of four types of signals:
 component video (PAL or NTSC, depending on where the equipment was 
sold), composite video, stereo audio, or S/PDIF audio.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/8/1/0/1/4/51141d1ace395fff7d000005.jpg"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/51141d1ace395fff7d000005.jpg" alt="Female RCA plug, for video signals."></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8631">Female RCA connector</a>, for video signals. Typically, NTSC or PAL video signal connectors will be yellow.</em></p>

<p>Male RCA connectors are usually found on cables.</p>

          <div class="section tutorial-page">
        <h2 id="power-connectors">Power Connectors</h2>
        <p>While many connectors carry power in addition to data, some 
connectors are used specifically to provide power connections to 
devices. These vary widely by application and size, but we will only 
focus on some of the most common ones here.</p>

<h3>Barrel Connectors</h3>

<p>Barrel connectors are typically found on low-cost consumer electronics which can be plugged into wall power via bulky <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8269?">AC wall adaptors</a>.
 Wall adaptors are widely available, in a variety of power ratings and 
voltages, making barrel connectors a common means for connecting power 
to small projects.</p>

<p>The female barrel connector, or “jack”, can be purchased in several 
varieties: PCB mounted (surface mount or through hole), cable mount, or 
panel mount. Some of these connectors will have an additional contact 
that allows the application to detect whether a power supply is plugged 
into the barrel jack or not, thus allowing the device to bypass 
batteries and save battery life when running on external power.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/a/6/c/e/3/51141da0ce395fe67e000005.jpg"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/51141da0ce395fe67e000005.jpg" alt="Female barrel connector"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/119">Female barrel connector</a>. When no plug is inserted, the “insertion detection” pin will be shorted to the “sleeve” pin.</em></p>

<p>The male barrel connector, or “plug”, is usually only found in a wire
 termination variety, although there are multiple methods of attaching 
the plug to the end of the wire. It’s also possible to get plugs that 
come pre-attached to a cable.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/e/b/d/c/3/51141dfdce395fe801000002.jpg"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/51141dfdce395fe801000002.jpg" alt="Male barrel plug"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11476">Unattached male barrel plug</a>,
 for attachment to any power supply. Note that the sleeve connection is 
designed to be crimped onto the wire for extra strain relief.</em></p>

<p>Barrel connectors provide only two connections, frequently referred 
to as “pin” or “tip” and “sleeve”. When ordering, there are three 
differentiating characteristics of a barrel connection- inner diameter 
(the diameter of the pin inside the jack), outer diameter (the diameter 
of the sleeve on the outside of the plug), and polarity (whether the 
sleeve voltage is higher or lower than the tip voltage).</p>

<p><strong>Sleeve diameter</strong> is most commonly either 5.5mm or 3.5mm.</p>

<p><strong>Pin diameter</strong> is contingent upon sleeve diameter; a 
5.5mm sleeve will have either a 2.5mm or 2.1mm pin. Unfortunately, this 
means that a plug designed for a 2.5mm pin will fit in a 2.1mm jack, but
 that the connection will be, at best, intermittent. 3.5mm sleeve plugs 
usually mate to a jack with a 1.3mm pin.</p>

<p><strong>Polarity</strong> is the final aspect to consider; most 
often, the sleeve will be considered 0V and the tip will be a positive 
voltage relative to the sleeve. Many devices will have a small diagram 
indicating the polarity expected by the device; care should be taken to 
adhere to this, as an improper power supply may damage the device.</p>

<p>Plugs of both sleeve sizes are usually 9.5mm long, but longer and 
shorter ones do exist. All SparkFun products use a positive polarity 
5.5mm sleeve and a 2.1mm pin; we recommend sticking to that standard 
where possible, as it seems to be the most common flavor found in the 
wild.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/2/f/6/e/0/5113f704ce395ffc7d000000.png"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/5113f704ce395ffc7d000000.png" alt="Barrel connector polarity label"></a></p>

adaptors with barrel plugs. Positive polarity (tip positive, sleeve 0V)

<h3>“Molex” Connectors</h3>

<p>Most computer hard drives, optical drives, and other internal 
peripherals get power through what is typically called a “Molex” 
connector. To be more accurate, it’s a Molex series 8981 connector–Molex
 is actually the name of the company which initially designed this 
connector back in the 1950s–but common usage has denuded that fact 
somewhat.</p>

<p>Molex connectors are designed to carry a lot of current: up to 11A 
per pin. For projects where a lot of power may be needed–a CNC machine, 
for instance, or a 3D printer- a very common method for powering the 
project is to use a desktop PC power supply and connecting the various 
system circuits through Molex connectors.</p>

<p>The Molex connector is one where the male/female terminology is a bit
 odd. The female connector is usually found on the end of a cable, and 
it slips inside of a plastic shell which surrounds the male pins on the 
male connector. Usually, the connectors are press-fit only, and very, 
very tight–they are intended to be connected and disconnected only a few
 times and, as such, are a bad choice for systems where connections will
 frequently be changed.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/5/d/e/d/6/51141ecdce395fba7d00000a.jpg"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/51141ecdce395fba7d00000a.jpg" alt="Male Molex connector"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11297">Male Molex connector</a>. The gender of the pins inside the connector is what signifies the gender of the connector as a whole.</em></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em>Female Molex connector on a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11296">project power supply</a>.</em></p>

<h3>IEC Connector</h3>

<p>As with the Molex connector, this is a case where a generalized 
component name has come to be synonymous with a single, particular item.
 IEC connector usually refers to the power supply inlet which is 
commonly seen on desktop PC power supplies. Strictly speaking, that’s an
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iec_connector">IEC 60320-1</a> C13 (female) and C14 (male) connector.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/e/1/f/b/4/51141f68ce395fbf7d00000b.jpg"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/51141f68ce395fbf7d00000b.jpg" alt="IEC 60320-1 C14 male connector"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em>C14 male IEC power inlet, on a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11296">DC project power supply</a>. Note that, as with the Molex connector, the gender of the connector is defined by the pins within the hood.</em></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/9/6/1/7/0/51141f68ce395f7d7e00000c.jpg"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/51141f68ce395f7d7e00000c.jpg" alt="C13 female IEC power connector"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em>C13 female IEC power connector, on a fairly standard <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11299">AC power supply cable</a>. Cables with this end can be found all around the world, usually with the dominant local AC connector at the other end.</em></p>

<p>IEC connectors are used almost exclusively for AC power input. The 
nice thing about using one on a project is that IEC-to-wall cables are 
extremely common <em>and</em> available with localized wall plugs for most international locations!</p>

<h3>JST Connector</h3>

<p>At SparkFun, we frequently refer to “2.0mm JST Connectors”. This is 
yet another generalization of a specific product- JST is a Japanese 
company which makes high-quality connectors, and our 2.0mm JST connector
 of choice is the PH series two-position polarized connector.</p>

<p>All of SparkFun’s single-cell lithium-polymer ion batteries come 
standard with this type of JST connector, and many of our boards include
 this connector (or a footprint for it) as a power supply input. It has 
the advantage of being compact, durable, and difficult to connect 
backwards. Another feature, which can be an advantage or a disadvantage,
 depending on how you look at it, is that the JST connector is wicked 
hard to disconnect (although a <a href="http://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/f/e/2/a/b/5114447cce395f7a7a000005.jpg">carefully applied diagonal cutter</a>
 can be helpful!) once it’s mated. While this makes it unlikely to fail 
during use, it also means that disconnecting the battery for charging 
can damage the battery connector.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/9/6/8/5/c/51142023ce395ff633000005.jpg"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/51142023ce395ff633000005.jpg" alt="2-Pin JST male connector on a LilyPad Arduino USB board"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9914">Male and female 2-pin JST connectors</a>.</em></p>

<p>There are PH series connectors with more than two positions; SparkFun
 even sells them. However, our most frequent application is for the 
2-position battery connection.</p>      </div>
          <div class="section tutorial-page">
        <h2 id="pin-header-connectors">Pin Header Connectors</h2>
        <p>Pin header connectors comprise several different means of 
connection. Generally, one side is a series of pins which are soldered 
to a PCB, and they can either be at a right-angle to the PCB surface 
(usually called “straight”) or parallel to the board’s surface 
(confusingly referred to as “right-angle” pins). Such connectors come in
 a variety of pitches, and may have any number of individual rows of 
pins.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/7/4/e/2/f/511420f6ce395f157b000003.jpg"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/511420f6ce395f157b000003.jpg" alt="Right angle female header pin connector"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em>Right-angle female header pin connection on an <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9716">FTDI basic</a> board.</em></p>

<p>The most commonly seen pin headers are .1" single or double row connectors. These come in <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/116">male</a> and <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/115">female</a>
 versions, and are the connectors used to connect Arduino boards and 
shields together. Other pitches are not uncommon; for instance, the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8664">XBee wireless module</a> uses a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8272">2.0mm pitch</a> version of the same connector.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em>.1" pin header connectors, male and female, on an Arduino Uno board.</em></p>

<p>A common variation on this part is a “machine pin” version. While the
 normal version is formed out of stamped and folded sheet metal, machine
 pin connectors are formed by tooling the metal into the desired shape. 
The result is a more robust connector, with a better joint and longer 
life, making it somewhat more expensive.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/d/4/8/d/a/5114022cce395f547e000003.jpg"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/5114022cce395f547e000003.jpg" alt="Female machine pin headers"></a></p>

mate with the machine pin variety.</em></p>

<p>Cables made to connect to these pin headers are usually one of two types:  individual wires with <strong>crimp</strong> connectors on them or ribbon cables with <strong>insulation displacement</strong>
 connectors. These can simply be clamped onto the end of a ribbon cable,
 which creates a connection to each one of the conductors in the ribbon 
cable. Generally, cables are only available as female gender and expect a
 male pin to mate with.</p>

 This type of cable can be quickly assembled because it does not require

        <h3>Screw Terminals</h3>

<p>In some cases, it may be desirable to be able to connect bare, 
unterminated wire to a circuit. Screw terminals provide a good solution 
for this. They are also good for situations in which a connection should
 be capable of supporting multiple different connecting devices.</p>

<p>The downside of screw terminals is that they can come undone fairly 
easily, leaving a bare wire waving around in your circuit. A small dab 
of hot glue can address this without being too difficult to remove 
later.</p>

<p>Screw terminals are typically designed for a narrow range of wire 
gauges, and wires that are too small can be as big a problem as wires 
that are too big. SparkFun carries two types of screw terminal–a .1" 
pitch version and a 3.5mm version. Most screw terminals are highly 
modular, and they can easily be extended at the same pitch by simply 
connecting two or more smaller sections together.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/d/6/c/4/a/511422cdce395feb01000003.jpg"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/511422cdce395feb01000003.jpg" alt="3.5mm screw terminals"></a></p>

<h3>Banana Connector</h3>

<p>Most pieces of power test equipment (multimeters, power supplies) 
have a very simple connector called a “banana jack” on it. These mate to
 “banana plugs”, crimped, sprung metal plugs, meant to make a single 
power connection. They are frequently available in a stackable 
configuration and can be easily connected to any type of wire. They are 
capable of carrying several amps of current and are inexpensive.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/8/c/a/2/7/5114231ece395f7e7e000002.jpg"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/5114231ece395f7e7e000002.jpg" alt="Banana plug"></a></p>

<h3>Alligator Clip</h3>

<p>Named for obvious reasons, alligator clips are good for test 
connections to posts or bare wires. They tend to be bulky, easily cause 
shorts to nearby bare metal, and have a reasonably poor grip that can be
 easily compromised. They are primarily used for low-cost connections 
during debugging.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/4/b/e/5/4/5114236dce395fa17e000006.jpg"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/5114236dce395fa17e000006.jpg" alt="Alligator clips"></a></p>

Note the plastic boot surrounding the alligator clip, to make it less likely to short to other connections.</em></p>

<h3>IC Clip (or IC Hook)</h3>

<p>For more delicate probing operations, there are a variety of IC clips
 on the market. These are sized to allow a user to clip them onto the 
pins of an IC without contacting adjacent pins; some of them are 
delicate enough to be clipped onto even fine-pitched SMD component legs.
 These smaller clips can be found on <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8938">logic analyzers</a> as well as <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/501">test leads</a>, which are great for prototyping or troubleshooting circuits.</p>

        <h3>RJ-type Modular Connectors</h3>

<p><strong>Registered jack</strong> connectors are standard for 
telecommunications equipment into a local exchange. The names one 
normally hears associated with them (RJ45, RJ12, etc) are not 
necessarily correct, as the RJ designator is a based on a combination of
 the number of positions, the number of conductors actually present, and
 the wiring pattern. For example, while the ends of a standard ethernet 
cable are usually referred to as “RJ45”, RJ45 actually implies not only 
an 8 position, 8 conductor modular jack, it also implies that it is 
wired for ethernet.</p>

<p>These modular connectors can be very useful, since they combine ready
 availability, multiple conductors, moderate flexibility, low cost, and 
moderate current carrying capacity. While not originally intended to 
deliver a great deal of power, these cables can be used to deliver data 
and a couple of hundred milliamps from one device to another. Care 
should be taken to ensure that jacks provided for applications like this
 are not connected to conventional ethernet ports, as damage will 
result.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/9/b/6/b/4/51142492ce395f8301000005.jpg"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/51142492ce395f8301000005.jpg" alt="8p8c &quot;RJ45&quot; style modular jack"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em>A standard 8p8c (8-position, 8-conductor) <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/643">“RJ45” modular jack</a>. Be aware that if you intend to use this type of jack to pass DC signals and power, you must avoid using connectors with <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8534">built-in signal transformers</a>.</em></p>

<h3>D-sub Type Connectors</h3>

<p>Named for the shape of their shell, D-subminiature connectors are a 
classic standard in the computing world. There are four very common 
varieties of this connector: DA-15, DB-25, DE-15, and DE-9. The pin 
number indicates the number of connections provided, and the letter 
combination indicates the size of the shell. Thus, DE-15 and DE-9 have 
the same shell size, but a different number of connections.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/6/5/6/b/8/51142492ce395fe901000004.jpg"><img src="Connector%20Basics%20-%20learn.sparkfun.com_files/51142492ce395fe901000004.jpg" alt="Female board-mount DE9 connector"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <em><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/429">Female DE-9 board-mount connector</a>.
 Gender is defined by the pins or sockets associated with each signal, 
not the connector as a whole, making this connector female despite the 
fact that it effectively inserts into the shell of the mating connector.</em></p>

<p>DB-25 and DE-9 are the most useful to the hardware hacker; many 
desktop computers still include at least one DE-9 serial port, and often
 one DB-25 parallel port. Cables terminated with <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/65?">DE-9</a> and <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/64?">DB-25</a>
 connectors are widely available, too. As with the modular connector 
above, these can be used to provide power and point-to-point 
communications between two devices. Again, since the common usage of 
these cables does <em>not</em> include power transmission, it is very 
important that any repurposing of the cables be done cautiously, as a 
non-standard device plugged into a standard port can easily cause 
damage.</p>      </div>
